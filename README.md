Introduction

Heatwaves can have severe impacts on human health, agriculture, and various sectors of society. This machine learning model utilizes historical weather data and other relevant features to predict the likelihood of a heatwave occurrence. By identifying potential heatwave events in advance, stakeholders can take appropriate measures to minimize the negative consequences.
Features

The heatwave prediction model includes the following features:

    Temperature: Daily maximum temperature recorded.
    Humidity: Daily average humidity levels.
    Wind Speed: Average wind speed during the day.
    Precipitation: Rainfall or precipitation recorded on the given day.
    Solar Radiation: Daily average solar radiation.
    Pressure: Atmospheric pressure recorded.

These features are used as inputs to the machine learning model to predict the occurrence of heatwaves.
Installation

To run the heatwave prediction model, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    shell

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heatwave-prediction-model.git

Install the required dependencies:

shell

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Set up the environment and data:
        Place the input data file in the appropriate directory.
        Update the file path and configuration settings in the code as necessary.

Usage

To use the heatwave prediction model, follow these steps:

    Prepare your input data in the required format.
    Load the trained model using the provided code.
    Provide the input data to the model for prediction.
    Analyze the model's prediction output.

Make sure to refer to the documentation or code comments for specific usage instructions and examples.
Data

The heatwave prediction model relies on historical weather data for training and testing. The input data should include the required features (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, solar radiation, pressure) for each day. Ensure that the data is properly preprocessed and in a suitable format before using it with the model.
Model Training

If you wish to train your own heatwave prediction model, refer to the model_training.py file in the repository. This script provides the necessary code to preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train the machine learning model using the selected algorithm.
Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the heatwave prediction model, various evaluation metrics can be used. These may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). The chosen metrics should be appropriate for the problem and reflect the model's ability to correctly predict heatwave occurrences.
